# **Sacred Skirmish**
Sacred Skirmish is a 1v1 strategy game I am currently developing. It will be set in an ancient/fantasy world with different factions who worship different gods fight each other until only the strongest survives.

## Patch Notes
### V0.1:
This is the very first prototype of the game, and thus only has the bare minimum features required to allow the game to function. Note that since there is no proper matchmaking system, the game not realistically available to play yet.

New Mechanics:
- Basic multiplayer functionality (untested)
- Unit tier system
- Two new buildings:
    - Marketplace: Increases money per turn by $100
    - Barracks: Trains one unit at a time, each unit takes 3 turns to train
- Holy sites (Note: while these are visually implemented, they currently serve no gameplay purposes)
- Dynamic map that is initially hidden, but can be discovered as you move units
- Line of sight system, requiring units to be close by to see enemy units/buildings
- VERY basic artwork/animation
